Analysis of Airline Passenger satisfaction records

## Abstract:
This paper presents a comprehensive data analysis of an airline passenger satisfaction records dataset, aiming to explore various factors affecting passenger satisfaction. The dataset includes information about the traveler, such as gender and age, as well as details about the travel, like the purpose of the flight, class in the airplane, flight distance, and departure and arrival delays. Additionally, it contains indicators of customer satisfaction regarding different aspects of the airline service.

## Introduction:
Airline passenger satisfaction is a crucial aspect of the aviation industry. Understanding the factors that influence passenger satisfaction is essential for airlines to improve their services and enhance the overall travel experience. In this study, we analyze a comprehensive dataset containing information about the traveler and the travel itself, along with various indicators of customer satisfaction. The objective is to uncover meaningful insights and correlations between different variables to gain a deeper understanding of what drives passenger satisfaction.

## Methodology:
- Exploration: An exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain initial insights into the dataset's characteristics. 

- Upload and Conversion: The dataset was uploaded as a CSV file to Google Drive and subsequently converted into Google Spreadsheets to facilitate data handling and analysis.

- Filtering and Consistency Check: A data filter was applied to ensure that all fields in the dataset contained coherent data. This step aimed to validate the data's integrity and consistency.

- Completeness Check: The dataset was thoroughly examined for missing values. Since no missing data was found, there was no need for imputation or further data cleaning.

- Visualization tool: The verified dataset was connected to Google Looker Studio as the chosen endpoint for data analysis.

- Analysis: The main focus of the analysis was to identify significant relationships between the traveler's attributes, travel details, and customer satisfaction indicators. Correlation analysis, regression models, and other statistical methods were employed to uncover patterns and associations in the data.

## Conclusions:
The analysis of the airline passenger satisfaction records dataset revealed valuable insights into the factors affecting passenger satisfaction. Several key findings can assist airlines in improving their services:

- Passengers' demographic attributes, such as gender and age, play a role in determining their overall satisfaction and satisfaction with specific services.
- Business travelers may have different expectations and satisfaction levels compared to personal travelers.
- Flight delays have a negative impact on passenger satisfaction, emphasizing the importance of efficient operations.
- Providing a seamless online booking and check-in experience positively affects passenger satisfaction.
- The airport gate location significantly influences passenger satisfaction, indicating the importance of convenient boarding processes.
- In-flight amenities, such as WiFi, entertainment, and food and drink options, directly impact passenger satisfaction levels.
- Comfortable seating and sufficient leg room contribute significantly to overall satisfaction.
- Ensuring a smooth and satisfactory baggage handling process is crucial for overall customer satisfaction.

By understanding these relationships, airlines can make informed decisions to enhance their services, address pain points, and create a more delightful travel experience for passengers. The findings from this study can serve as a valuable foundation for further research and improvements in the aviation industry.
